# Supermarket Inventory Management System

This project leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and image processing capabilities to manage supermarket inventories based on pictures and live videos. The system aims to streamline the inventory management process by automatically recognizing products, counting them, and updating the inventory in real-time.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Analyze pictures of supermarket shelves to recognize and count products.
- **Live Video Processing**: Use live video feeds to continuously monitor and update inventory.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: Utilize OpenAI's advanced models for product recognition and data processing.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- An OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Othmane9011/Inventaire.git
    cd Inventaire
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install python
    pip install openai
    ```

4. **Set your OpenAI API key**:
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
        ```
    - On Windows:
        ```cmd
        set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
        ```
